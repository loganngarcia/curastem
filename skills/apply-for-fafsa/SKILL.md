# Apply for FAFSA

Guide students through completing the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) using Curastem's tools. Curastem provides: the **document editor** for checklists, document lists, and draft answers, and the **whiteboard** for timeline visualization and process flowcharts.

## Curastem Tools to Use

### 1. Document Editor (update_doc)
Use to create FAFSA preparation checklists: documents needed (SSN, tax returns, bank statements, etc.), step-by-step instructions, and draft answers for common questions. Write a pre-application checklist they can work through. Format with clear headings and checkable items.

### 2. Whiteboard (update_whiteboard)
Use to visualize the FAFSA timeline: when to start, deadline dates, verification steps, award notification. Create a flowchart of the process: gather docs → create FSA ID → complete form → submit → verification (if selected) → receive SAR. Helps students see the full picture.

### 3. Retrieve Resources
Use to fetch Curastem's curated FAFSA and financial aid resources: official links, state deadlines, verification guides. Include a brief personalized intro when calling.

## When to Apply

- Student wants to apply for FAFSA or federal financial aid
- Student asks what documents they need or how to start
- Student is confused about deadlines, verification, or next steps
- Student needs help with FSA ID, dependency status, or specific questions

## Workflow

1. **Checklist** — Use doc editor to list required documents and create FSA ID
2. **Timeline** — Use whiteboard to map deadlines and process steps
3. **Resources** — Call retrieve_resources for official FAFSA links and state-specific info
4. **Support** — Use doc for draft answers or clarification on tricky sections

## Key Guidance

- FAFSA opens October 1; state and school deadlines vary—emphasize early filing
- Dependency status, FSA ID, and tax information are common pain points
- Use doc for all written checklists and prep; use whiteboard for timelines
- Encourage students to use the official FAFSA help and their school's financial aid office
