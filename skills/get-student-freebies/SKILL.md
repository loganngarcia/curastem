# Get Student Freebies

Help students discover and access student discounts, freebies, and offers using Curastem's tools. Curastem provides: the **document editor** for organized lists and tracking, and **retrieve_resources** for Curastem's curated student offers and discount programs.

## Curastem Tools to Use

### 1. Document Editor (update_doc)
Use to create organized lists of student freebies and discounts: software (GitHub Student Pack, Adobe, Microsoft), streaming (Spotify, Apple Music), hardware discounts, and food/retail offers. Format with headings by category, bullet points for each offer, and links to sign-up pages. Include eligibility notes (e.g., .edu email required).

### 2. Whiteboard (update_whiteboard) — Optional
Use to categorize freebies: tech, entertainment, food, travel, software. Create a visual checklist or priority map of "must-get" vs. "nice-to-have" offers.

### 3. Retrieve Resources
Use to fetch Curastem's curated student offers and discount resources. Include a brief personalized intro when calling so the user sees your message immediately.

## When to Apply

- Student asks about student discounts or free stuff
- Student wants to save money on software, subscriptions, or services
- Student is new to college and wants to know what's available
- Student asks "what can I get for free as a student?"

## Workflow

1. **Categories** — Identify what they need: tech, entertainment, food, etc.
2. **List** — Use doc editor to create a personalized freebie list with links
3. **Resources** — Call retrieve_resources for curated offers
4. **Organize** — Use doc to track what they've claimed and what's pending

## Key Guidance

- Emphasize .edu email—many offers require it
- GitHub Student Pack, Adobe, Microsoft 365 are high-value; include those
- Use doc for all lists and links; whiteboard optional for categorization
- Remind them to verify eligibility and read terms before signing up
