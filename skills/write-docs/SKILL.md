# Write Docs

Guide students through creating documents using Curastem's **document editor**. Use for essays, reports, notes, letters, outlines, study guides, or any written content. The doc editor supports full HTML formatting—headings, bullets, bold, links—and students can edit directly, copy out, or export.

## Curastem Tools to Use

### 1. Document Editor (update_doc) — Primary Tool
Use to write, structure, and format documents. Create sections with <h2>, paragraphs with <p>, lists with <ul>/<li>, emphasis with <b> or <i>, links with <a>. Supports essays, reports, meeting notes, letters, outlines, and study guides. Students edit in place and copy into Word, Google Docs, or applications.

### 2. Whiteboard (update_whiteboard) — Optional
Use to plan before writing: outline structure, mind map of ideas, or flowchart of sections. Helps organize thoughts and flow.

## When to Apply

- Student wants to write an essay, report, or document
- Student asks for help drafting notes, letters, or outlines
- Student needs structured written content
- Student wants to organize ideas into a document

## Workflow

1. **Gather** — Get their topic, purpose, and key points
2. **Plan** — Optionally use whiteboard to outline structure
3. **Draft** — Use update_doc to create the document
4. **Refine** — Edit content, add sections, or improve clarity based on feedback

## Key Guidance

- Match structure to purpose: intro, body, conclusion for essays
- Use headings to create clear sections and improve scannability
- Keep paragraphs focused; one main idea per paragraph
- Encourage iteration; students can refine directly in the doc
