# Make PDF

Guide students through creating well-formatted documents that they can export or print as PDF. Use Curastem's **document editor** to produce clean, print-ready content with proper headings, sections, and layout. Students use browser Print → Save as PDF, or copy into Google Docs/Word and export.

## Curastem Tools to Use

### 1. Document Editor (update_doc) — Primary Tool
Use to create print-ready content: <h1> for title, <h2> for sections, <p> for paragraphs, <ul>/<li> for lists. Keep layout clean: avoid wide tables, use page-break-friendly structure. Students can copy into Google Docs or Word, apply formatting, then File → Download as PDF. Or use browser Print (Ctrl/Cmd+P) → Save as PDF on the Curastem doc view.

### 2. Whiteboard (update_whiteboard) — Optional
Use to plan document structure: outline of sections, flow of content, or diagram of key points. Helps organize before writing.

## When to Apply

- Student wants to create a document they can save as PDF
- Student needs a handout, report, or printable document
- Student asks how to export or print to PDF
- Student wants professional-looking content for submission

## Workflow

1. **Gather** — Get their content needs: type of document, sections, audience
2. **Plan** — Optionally use whiteboard to outline structure
3. **Draft** — Use update_doc to create formatted content
4. **Refine** — Adjust layout, add sections, or fix formatting for clean PDF export

## Key Guidance

- Use semantic HTML: headings for hierarchy, paragraphs for readability
- Avoid very wide content; keep within typical page width
- Suggest: copy to Google Docs → adjust margins/fonts → Download as PDF
- Or: use browser Print on the doc panel → Destination: Save as PDF
- Include title and clear section breaks for professional output
