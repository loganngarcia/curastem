# 🩵 Curastem — Omegle for mentorship

**The future of mentorship lives here.**

web.tsx is the heart of [Curastem](https://curastem.org) — a single, powerful Framer component that brings real-time mentorship to the web. Think of it as Omegle for mentorship: students connect with mentors over video, or chat with AI for instant help with resumes, scholarships, college apps, internships, and everything in between.

This isn't just a chatbot. It's a full mentorship experience: video calls, AI-powered assistance, collaborative whiteboards, document editing, and a mini IDE — all packed into one open-source component that anyone can drop into their site.

*Pssst. Hey, you, join our stargazers ⭐️*

## Why This Matters

Millions of students struggle to find guidance. They don't know where to start with FAFSA, how to write a resume, or how to prepare for college applications. Mentorship has always been gatekept. **Curastem changes that.**

By making this component open source, we're inviting the world to help us scale what works. Every improvement, every fix, every new feature makes mentorship more accessible. That's the mission.

---

## What's Inside

- **Real-time video mentorship** — Connect students with mentors instantly
- **Gemini AI integration** — Smart, contextual help 24/7
- **Voice-in, voice-out** — Talk to AI naturally with Gemini Live
- **Collaborative tools** — Whiteboard (Tldraw), document editor, mini IDE
- **Shareable sessions** — Unique links (`#aeb-cid-xyz`) for easy sharing
- **Mobile-first** — Built for the devices students actually use
