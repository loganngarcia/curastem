# Create a Resume

Guide students through creating and refining resumes using Curastem's **document editor** (update_doc). The doc editor supports full HTML formatting—headings, bullet points, bold, links—and is the primary tool for resume creation. Students can copy the content into Word, Google Docs, or application systems.

## Curastem Tools to Use

### 1. Document Editor (update_doc) — Primary Tool
Use to write, structure, and format resumes. Create sections: Contact, Summary/Objective, Education, Experience, Skills, Projects, Activities. Use <h2> for section headings, <ul>/<li> for bullet points, <b> for emphasis. Ensure clean, scannable layout. Students can edit directly in the doc and copy out.

### 2. Whiteboard (update_whiteboard) — Optional
Use for resume strategy: mind map of skills and experiences to include, flowchart of sections, visual prioritization of content. Helps students organize before writing.

## When to Apply

- Student wants to create a new resume or update an existing one
- Student asks for resume structure, formatting, or content advice
- Student needs to tailor a resume for a specific role
- Student is unsure what to include or how to describe experiences

## Workflow

1. **Gather** — Ask about their experiences, education, skills, and target role
2. **Plan** — Optionally use whiteboard to map sections and content
3. **Draft** — Use update_doc to create a full resume with proper formatting
4. **Refine** — Iterate on content, wording, and structure based on feedback

## Key Guidance

- Use action verbs and quantify impact where possible
- Tailor content to the target role; one-size-fits-all rarely works
- Keep it to one page for students with limited experience; two pages only if justified
- Format: clear headings, consistent spacing, no graphics (for ATS compatibility when applicable)
