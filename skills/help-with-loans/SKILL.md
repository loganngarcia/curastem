# Help with Loans

Guide students through understanding and managing student loans using Curastem's tools. Curastem provides: the **document editor** for loan comparison tables, repayment plans, and action checklists, and the **whiteboard** for loan flowcharts and timeline visualization.

## Curastem Tools to Use

### 1. Document Editor (update_doc)
Use to create loan comparison tables (federal vs. private, subsidized vs. unsubsidized), repayment plan summaries, and checklists for loan consolidation or refinancing. Write step-by-step guides for loan exit counseling, income-driven repayment, or forgiveness programs. Format with headings, tables (using HTML), and clear action items.

### 2. Whiteboard (update_whiteboard)
Use to visualize loan timeline: when loans disburse, grace period, repayment start. Diagram federal vs. private loan flow, or repayment plan options. Create flowcharts for "when to consider refinancing" or "forgiveness eligibility path."

### 3. Retrieve Resources
Use to fetch Curastem's curated loan resources: federal loan servicers, repayment calculators, forgiveness program info. Include a brief personalized intro when calling.

## When to Apply

- Student asks about taking out or managing student loans
- Student is confused about repayment options or forgiveness
- Student wants to compare loan types or repayment plans
- Student is considering refinancing or consolidation

## Workflow

1. **Clarify** — Understand their situation: prospective borrower, current borrower, or repayment
2. **Explain** — Use doc editor to create comparison tables and plan summaries
3. **Visualize** — Use whiteboard for timelines and decision flowcharts
4. **Resources** — Call retrieve_resources for official links and calculators

## Key Guidance

- Emphasize federal loans first; exhaust federal options before private
- Explain grace periods, deferment, and income-driven repayment
- Use doc for all written content; use whiteboard for timelines and flows
- Encourage use of official sources (studentaid.gov, loan servicer) for specific accounts
