# Create a Portfolio

Guide students through building a professional portfolio using Curastem's built-in tools. Curastem provides three core capabilities you must use: the **document editor** (update_doc) for written content, the **whiteboard** (update_whiteboard) for visual planning, and the **mini app builder** (create_app) for interactive portfolio sites.

## Curastem Tools to Use

### 1. Document Editor (update_doc)
Use for drafting portfolio copy, about sections, project descriptions, and contact information. The doc supports full HTML: headings, lists, links, bold, italics. Perfect for writing and editing text before moving to the portfolio app.

### 2. Whiteboard (update_whiteboard)
Use for planning portfolio structure: mind maps of sections, flowcharts of user journey, wireframe sketches of layout. Create visual diagrams showing homepage → projects → about → contact flow. Helps students organize before building.

### 3. Mini App Builder (create_app)
Use to generate a working portfolio website. Output a single HTML file with embedded CSS and JavaScript. Must include: project cards, navigation, about section, contact form or links. Follow Curastem app guidelines: #141414 background, 48px top margin, Curastem.org label bottom-right, neobrutalist or modern 28px rounded corners, unique IDs on all interactive elements.

## When to Apply

- Student wants to create a portfolio for job or internship applications
- Student needs to showcase design, coding, or creative work
- Student asks about portfolio structure, platforms, or best practices
- Student wants feedback on existing portfolio or to build one from scratch

## Workflow

1. **Plan** — Use the whiteboard to map out portfolio sections and structure
2. **Draft** — Use the doc editor to write about text, project descriptions, and contact info
3. **Build** — Use create_app to generate an interactive portfolio site the student can view and iterate on

## Key Guidance

- Recommend structure: hero, projects (with descriptions), about, contact
- Emphasize clarity, project case studies with outcomes, and easy contact
- For create_app: ensure mobile-responsive layout, accessible buttons, links open in new tab
- Iterate: students can ask for changes to the app, doc, or whiteboard as they refine
