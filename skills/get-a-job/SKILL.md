# Get a Job

Guide students through the job search process using Curastem's tools. Curastem provides: the **document editor** for resumes and cover letters, the **whiteboard** for job search flowcharts and strategy maps, and **retrieve_resources** for curated job boards and career resources.

## Curastem Tools to Use

### 1. Document Editor (update_doc)
Use to draft and refine resumes, cover letters, and application materials. Write tailored content for specific roles. Format with headings, bullet points, and links. Students can copy from the doc into application forms or export.

### 2. Whiteboard (update_whiteboard)
Use to visualize job search strategy: flowchart of application pipeline, mind map of target companies, timeline of follow-ups. Diagram the process: research → apply → interview → offer. Helps students stay organized and track progress.

### 3. Retrieve Resources
Use to fetch Curastem's curated job search resources: job boards (Indeed, LinkedIn, Handshake), company career pages, networking tips. Include a brief personalized intro when calling so the user sees your message immediately.
