# Get an Internship

Guide students through finding and securing internships using Curastem's tools. Curastem provides: the **document editor** for resumes, cover letters, and application tracking, the **whiteboard** for search strategy and timeline visualization, and **retrieve_resources** for internship boards and opportunities.

## Curastem Tools to Use

### 1. Document Editor (update_doc)
Use to draft internship-specific resumes, cover letters, and thank-you emails. Create application trackers with company names, roles, deadlines, and status. Format with headings for each application phase and bullet points for key accomplishments.

### 2. Whiteboard (update_whiteboard)
Use to visualize internship search strategy: target companies by industry, application timeline, networking flowchart. Diagram the process: research → apply → interview → offer. Map out fall vs. spring vs. summer recruiting cycles.

### 3. Retrieve Resources
Use to fetch Curastem's curated internship resources: Handshake, LinkedIn, company career pages, industry-specific boards. Include a brief personalized intro when calling.

## When to Apply

- Student is unsure how to frame coursework or projects for internships

## Workflow
