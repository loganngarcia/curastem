# Contributing to Curastem

**Thank you for wanting to contribute!** Every contribution helps make mentorship more accessible to students who need it. Whether you're fixing a bug, improving accessibility, adding a feature, or improving documentation — you're part of something bigger.

---

## Getting Started

If you're contributing, the process is similar to other open source repos: fork the repo, make your changes, test them, and submit a PR. If you have any questions or would like help getting started, reach out by opening an issue or emailing us at [help@curastem.org](mailto:help@curastem.org).

---

## Where to Start

### 1. **Find Something to Work On**

- **Check open issues** — Look for issues labeled `good first issue` or `help wanted`
- **Report bugs** — Found something broken? Open an issue with details
- **Suggest features** — Have an idea? Start a discussion
- **Prototype with AI** — Got an idea? Prototype it quickly with AI and share in discussion
- **Improve docs** — Documentation improvements are always welcome
- **Fix accessibility** — Help us make mentorship accessible to everyone

### 2. **Set Up Your Environment**

#### Prerequisites
- A Framer account (free tier works)
- Node.js (if running tests locally)
- A code editor (Claude Code, Codex, or Cursor recommended) 

#### Fork and Clone
```bash
# Fork the repo on GitHub, then:
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/curastem.git
cd curastem
```

#### Get Familiar with the Codebase
- **Main component**: `web.tsx` — This is the heart of Curastem (23,500+ lines)
- **Code standards**: See `.cursorrules` for Framer component best practices
- **Architecture**: Single Framer code component that powers Curastem.org

## How to Contribute

### Making Changes

1. **Create a branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes**
   - Follow the code standards in `.cursorrules`
   - Write clear, self-documenting code
   - Add comments explaining the "why," not just the "what"
   - Test in Framer's preview mode

3. **Test your changes**
   - Test in Framer Canvas (should be lightweight)
   - Test in Framer Preview (full functionality)
   - Test on mobile if your changes affect mobile UX
   - Check accessibility (keyboard navigation, screen readers)

4. **Commit your changes**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Description of your changes"
   ```
   Write clear commit messages that explain what and why.

5. **Push to your fork**
   ```bash
   git push origin your-feature-name
   ```

6. **Open a Pull Request**
   - Go to the original repo on GitHub
   - Click "New Pull Request"
   - Select your fork and branch
   - Fill out the PR template (if available)
   - Describe what you changed and why

## Code Standards

We maintain high standards to keep the codebase maintainable for a large open-source community:

- **TypeScript** — Strong typing, avoid `any`
- **Accessibility** — Semantic HTML, ARIA labels, keyboard navigation
- **Performance** — Use `useIsStaticRenderer()` for animated components
- **Browser APIs** — Always guard with `typeof window !== "undefined"`
- **Comments** — Explain the "why," not just the "what"

See `.cursorrules` for detailed Framer component guidelines.
