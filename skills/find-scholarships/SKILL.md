# Find Scholarships

Guide students through finding and applying for scholarships using Curastem's tools. Curastem provides: the **document editor** for application essays and tracking lists, the **whiteboard** for deadline timelines and strategy maps, and **retrieve_resources** for curated scholarship databases and opportunities.

## Curastem Tools to Use

### 1. Document Editor (update_doc)
Use to draft scholarship essays, personal statements, and short-answer responses. Create tracking tables or lists of scholarships with deadlines and requirements. Format with headings for each scholarship, bullet points for criteria, and links to application portals.

### 2. Whiteboard (update_whiteboard)
Use to visualize scholarship strategy: timeline of deadlines, mind map of scholarship categories (merit, need-based, demographic, major-specific), flowchart of application steps. Diagram the process from search → shortlist → apply → follow-up.

### 3. Retrieve Resources
Use to fetch Curastem's curated scholarship resources: databases (Fastweb, Scholarships.com, Bold.org), institutional scholarships, niche opportunities. Include a brief personalized intro when calling.
