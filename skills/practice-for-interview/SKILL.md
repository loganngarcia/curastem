# Practice for Interview

Guide students through interview preparation using Curastem's tools. Curastem provides: the **document editor** for Q&A prep, STAR stories, and thank-you email drafts, and the **whiteboard** for interview flow diagrams and strategy maps.

## Curastem Tools to Use

### 1. Document Editor (update_doc)
Use to create interview prep documents: common questions with draft answers, STAR (Situation-Task-Action-Result) story outlines, company research notes, and thank-you email templates. Format with headings for question categories, bullet points for key points, and clear structure for easy reference.

### 2. Whiteboard (update_whiteboard)
Use to visualize interview flow: opening → behavioral questions → technical/case → questions for them → closing. Map out STAR story structure or decision frameworks for case interviews. Diagram "questions to ask them" categories.

## When to Apply

- Student has an upcoming interview and wants to prepare
- Student asks about common interview questions or how to answer
- Student needs help with STAR stories or behavioral questions
- Student wants to practice or get feedback on answers

## Workflow

1. **Research** — Understand the role and company; tailor prep accordingly
2. **Q&A** — Use doc editor to draft answers for common and role-specific questions
3. **Structure** — Use whiteboard to map interview flow and STAR story outlines
4. **Practice** — Encourage them to rehearse using the doc as a guide

## Key Guidance

- Focus on behavioral (STAR) and role-specific questions
- Help students identify 3–5 strong examples they can adapt to different questions
- Use doc for all written prep; use whiteboard for flow and structure
- Include "questions to ask them"—shows interest and preparation
