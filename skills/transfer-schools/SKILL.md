# Transfer Schools

Guide students through the college transfer process using Curastem's tools. Curastem provides: the **document editor** for application materials, credit articulation checklists, and timeline trackers, the **whiteboard** for transfer pathway visualization, and **retrieve_resources** for transfer guides and articulation agreements.

## Curastem Tools to Use

### 1. Document Editor (update_doc)
Use to create transfer checklists: required courses, GPA requirements, application deadlines. Draft personal statements for transfer applications. Build credit articulation tables (which courses transfer where). Format with headings, lists, and links to assist.org or school catalogs.

### 2. Whiteboard (update_whiteboard)
Use to visualize transfer pathways: community college → UC/CSU flow, prerequisite chains, timeline from start to transfer. Diagram the process: complete IGETC/GE → apply → accept → enroll. Map out major prerequisites and critical path.

### 3. Retrieve Resources
Use to fetch Curastem's curated transfer resources: UC TAP, CSU ASSIST, articulation agreements, transfer deadlines. Include a brief personalized intro when calling.

## When to Apply

- Student wants to transfer from community college to UC/CSU or another 4-year
- Student asks about transfer requirements, deadlines, or credit transfer
- Student needs help with transfer applications or personal statements
- Student is planning their community college coursework for transfer

## Workflow

1. **Pathway** — Use whiteboard to map transfer pathway and timeline
2. **Checklist** — Use doc editor to create course and application checklists
3. **Draft** — Use doc editor for transfer essays and personal statements
4. **Resources** — Call retrieve_resources for articulation and deadline info

## Key Guidance

- UC and CSU have specific pathways (IGETC, CSU GE); tailor to their target system
- Emphasize major prerequisites and GPA; many programs are impacted
- Use doc for all written content; use whiteboard for pathway visualization
- Assist.org and school catalogs are essential for credit articulation
